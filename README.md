📘 Abstract
This paper proposes a real-time heart rate monitoring system leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for continuous cardiac health observation. The conceptual design integrates an Arduino microcontroller, Bluetooth module (HC-05), and PPG/ECG-based heart rate sensors to track heart rate in real time.

Heart rate data is categorized into:

Bradycardia (Low)

Normal

Tachycardia (High)

Data is wirelessly transmitted to a smart device, enabling real-time monitoring, historical tracking, and instant alerts in case of anomalies.

⚙️ Technologies & Components (Conceptual)
📶 Bluetooth Module (HC-05) – For low-power, short-range wireless communication

🧠 Arduino Microcontroller – For real-time sensor data processing

❤️ PPG/ECG Sensor – For heart rate detection

📱 Smartphone Interface (conceptual) – To visualize data and trigger alerts

📊 Threshold-Based Classification Logic – To detect abnormal heart rate patterns

✨ Key Features (Proposed)
✅ Continuous heart rate tracking
✅ Wireless data transmission via Bluetooth
✅ Classification into low / normal / high zones
✅ Alert mechanism for out-of-threshold readings
✅ Foundation for ML-based predictive models

🔬 Future Scope
Integration of SpO2, temperature, and respiratory rate sensors

Implementation of Machine Learning for predictive analytics

Expansion into cloud-connected health platforms

Adoption of LoRaWAN / NB-IoT for long-range deployments
