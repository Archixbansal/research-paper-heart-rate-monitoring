## 📘 Abstract

This paper proposes a real-time heart rate monitoring framework utilizing **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies. The design concept includes an **Arduino microcontroller**, **Bluetooth module (HC-05)**, and a **PPG/ECG-based heart rate sensor** for continuous heart rate detection and classification.

Heart rate data is divided into three categories:
- **Bradycardia (Low)**
- **Normal**
- **Tachycardia (High)**

Data is transmitted wirelessly to a conceptual smartphone interface, allowing:
- Real-time alerts for anomalies
- Historical trend tracking
- Visual feedback for user interpretation
