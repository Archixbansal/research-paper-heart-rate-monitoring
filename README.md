## 📘 Abstract

This paper presents a real-time heart rate monitoring system using **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies. The system utilizes an **Arduino microcontroller**, **Bluetooth communication module**, and a **PPG/ECG-based heart rate sensor** to continuously capture and analyze cardiac activity.

Heart rate data is classified into three key zones:
- **Bradycardia** (Low)
- **Normal**
- **Tachycardia** (High)

The data is wirelessly transmitted to a companion smart device, which provides historical tracking, real-time alerts for anomalies, and visual feedback to users.
